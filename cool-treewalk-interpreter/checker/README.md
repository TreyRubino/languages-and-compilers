## Project Structure  
- `main.ml`: Entry point, loads AST, runs validations and type checking, and writes `.cl-type`  
- `env.ml`: Maintains parent map, method and attribute environments, and subtype helpers  
- `typecheck.ml`: Core type-checking engine implementing COOL’s static semantics  
- `validate.ml`: Validation checks including inheritance legality, duplicates, overrides, and scoping  
- `reader.ml`: Deserializers AST from `.cl-ast` file into memory  
- `writer.ml`: Emits `.cl-type` including class map, implementation map, parent map, and annotated AST  
- `ast.ml`: Shared type definitions for COOL programs and expressions (same as other phases)  
- `Makefile`: Build instructions for compiling with the OCaml toolchain  
- `build/`: Directory containing generated lexer artifacts and compiled output  
- `test/`: Test files displaying good and bad test cases  

## Overview  
The semantic analyzer phase extends the interpreter from syntactic analysis into static semantic enforcement.
It ensure that COOL programs respect the language's type system, inheritance constraints, and scoping rules before
they are eligible for execution. This phase reports errors such as refined base classes, inheritance from forbidden or
undefined classes, cycles in the class hierarchy, duplicate or illegal identifiers, invalid method overrides, undeclared
variables, and non conforming type in expressions and method bodies. By completing this stage, a program is guaranteed
to be type safe and ready for runtime execution.

## Design  
The analyzer constructs several global environments. The parent map tracks class inheritance and is checked for cycles 
and illegal bases. The method environment stores signatures for both built-in and user-defined methods, enforcing arity, 
parameter type, and return type compatibility with overrides. The attribute environment records class attributes, propagating
inherited fields and checking for redefinitions. Together these environments allowed for recursive type checking of expressions, 
supported by subtype reasoning and least upper bound computation for joins in conditional and case constructs. The type system 
distinguishes between `Class c` and `SELF_TYPE c`, with special handling to preserve static guarantees.

## Implementation  
The main function orchestrates semantic analysis by reading the input AST from the `.cl-ast` file, running validation passes,
seeding built-in classes, attributes, and methods, and then type-checking user-defined classes. Each expression is annotated with
its static type by the `type_check` function, which recursively enforces typing rules for arithmetic, conditionals, dispatches, 
lets, cases, and object creation. Special restrictions on `self`, `SELF_TYPE`, and primitive types are enforced during analysis. 
Validation routines check structural correctness prior to type checking, ensuring that all classes, methods, and attributes conform
to COOL's rules. On success, the system produces `.cl-type` file containing the class map, implementation map, parent map, and annotated
AST, forming the input to later runtime phases.

## Testing
Testing for the Semantic Analyzer focused on verifying type soundness, inheritance legality, and the overall enforcement of COOL’s static semantics. 
Unlike the Lexer and Parser, which shared structural and syntactic test suites, the Semantic Analyzer required an entirely separate collection 
of test programs crafted to exercise type-related and inheritance-specific rules. These tests were designed to confirm that only well-typed programs 
advanced to later stages while ill-typed ones were rejected with accurate and context-aware error messages.

Invalid test programs deliberately introduced semantic violations such as inheritance cycles, illegal redefinitions, mismatched return types, undeclared 
identifiers, and improper use of SELF_TYPE. To explore deeper edge cases, additional test inputs were automatically generated by injecting random type 
and identifier substitutions into valid COOL programs, then validated against the Stanford COOL reference compiler for expected behavior. The resulting 
corpus was further reduced through delta debugging to isolate minimal failing examples. These specialized tests were unique to the checker and entirely 
distinct from those used for the Interpreter phase, which evaluated dynamic behavior rather than static correctness. This separation of testing ensured 
the semantic analyzer was validated independently, with precise coverage of all static constraints defined by the COOL specification.
